1. What are optional variable in Swift

	In Swift we have 2 types of variables, 1. variables 2. Optional variables
	
	1. Variables -> we cannot assign nil to regular variables. We can regular variables implicitly and explicitly
	2. Optional variables -> we can assign nil to these variables and can only be declared as explicitly
		Syntax -> var name:String? = "John"
				name = nil // if you want to assign nil you can for optional variable

2. what is type safety

	Type safety is nothing but once you declared any variable as a certain datatype you cannot assign different datatype value to that variable. Non optional variables cannot be assigned nil(this case comes under type safety too).


3. how to create explict and implict variables
	
	Explicit(Optional variable) --> Syntax -> var name:String? = "John"
	Implicit --> Syntax  -> var name = "John"
	Explicit(Non Optional Variable)  --> Syntac ->  var name:String = "John"

4. diff b/w if let and guard let
	->These are used for optional binding(unwrapping the optional variable cause inside they are stored as wrapped with optional)
	 if let --> if let block, we unwrap number and bind its unwrapped value to value

5. what is optional binding and different ways

	->  optional binding(unwrapping the optional variable cause inside they are stored as wrapped with optional)

	Three ways to unwarp 1. if let 2. nil coalescing 3. Guard Let

6. syntax of for loop

For indexing-> 	for i in 0..100{
------statements 
}

For direct value access such as name array names = ["A","B", "C"]
for name in names{
print(name)
}
